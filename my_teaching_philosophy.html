					<h2>My Philosophy</h2>
					<p> As part of my philosophy, I would like to say what learning and education mean for me. Learning is an important process as it helps individuals acquire knowledge and use this knowledge for the betterment of the society. However, learning is not a one-directional activity, where an individual would gain knowledge by literally taking up certain activities or engaging in a given program. Instead, learning takes place both individually and in the community. Learning is a life-long process and one of the most important elements of life that give meaning to human existence. Education is the formal aspect of learning. It is formal because it takes place in organized settings of schools and colleges and through formal education we also acquire skills, experiences, and information needed to become creative, and productive for the society. Educations is the process that makes it possible to accumulate knowledge over the years and devise ways to use this knowledge for the benefit of humanity. From this perspective, my role as a teacher seems to be very important for the society. Therefore, to be able to perform this role fully I need to understand my own thinking, perspectives and beliefs. Teachers are important for learners because they are responsible for guiding them in the right direction and help them become what they want to. Teachers not only provide instruction to learners, but they also stand as an additional source of encouragement in the life of learners.</p>
